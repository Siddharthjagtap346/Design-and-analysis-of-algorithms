# Design And Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Portfolio
**Owner:** Siddharth Jagtap  
**Subject:** DAA  
**Purpose:** Showcase theoretical understanding and coding exercises in DAA topics and algorithms analysis.  

---

## Overview
This repository contains my **DAA assignments and small coding exercises** completed as part of my coursework and self-learning.  
Each assignment folder includes:

- **Code** (C++/Python)  
- **Explanation / Approach**  
- **Sample Input & Output / Results**  
- **Key concepts demonstrated**  

This portfolio is designed to show recruiters my problem-solving skills, coding ability, and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Assignments / Topics

| # | Assignment / Topic | Folder Link | Brief Description |
|---|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Fibonacci Series | [Fibonacci-Series](Fibonacci-Series/) | Recursive, Iterative & Binet’s Formula methods with step/time analysis |
| 2 | Huffman Encoding | [Huffman-Encoding](Huffman-Encoding/) | Construct Huffman Tree, encode/decode strings, compare bit usage |
| 3 | Fractional Knapsack | [Fractional-Knapsack](Fractional-Knapsack/) | Greedy algorithm for maximum value using fractional items |
| 4 | 0-1 Knapsack | [0-1-Knapsack](0-1-Knapsack/) | Dynamic Programming solution to classic 0-1 Knapsack problem |
| 5 | N-Queens Problem | [N-Queens](N-Queens/) | Backtracking solution displaying all valid board configurations |
| 6 | QuickSort | [QuickSort](QuickSort/) | Deterministic & Randomized QuickSort implementations |

## How to Use
1. Navigate to any assignment folder.  
2. Open the `README.md` to understand the **problem, approach, and results**.  
3. Open the corresponding code file (`.cpp`) to see the implementation.  
4. Run the code locally to test or modify as needed.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Recursion and Iterative Algorithms  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Backtracking  
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
- Tree & Heap Data Structures  
- Step counting and time complexity analysis  

---

## Notes
- Outputs shown in individual assignment READMEs are **sample runs**.  
- Code is written in **C++** with proper commenting for readability.  
- Recruiters can quickly browse folders to see **topic-wise differentiation** of assignments.
